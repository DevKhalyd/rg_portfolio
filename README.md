# RG Portfolio

My portfolio is a collection of projects that I have worked on üòâ.

## Inspiration

[Reddit]

Basically this user built a Google Search web site with the ReactJs framework.

When I saw this project I really wanted to copy but with Flutter for web.

So I built the Google Search portfolio [Google]

[Bloc]: The bloc library
[Icons]: The icons used

## Documentation

[Navigation] Basically in Flutter there is two ways to handle the navigation

## Testing

Context: One of my first apps to test.

**Why I should testing?**

- Found bugs and fix them quickly and easily (E.G. After of add a new feature)
- Provide Docs by its own (Refer to the tests when u want to see how it works the code)
- Unit tests make better designs

**What to be tested with Higher Priority?**

- Collections passed as parameter not changed in the method (add(1,2),expected: 3)
- Algorithm Engines (Because if someone changes the algorithm it will break the app or an unexpected behavior)
- Utility methods
- Core business logic methods
- Simple DB queries checking predicates
- Services that are high-risk (E.G. Auth, Storage, Database, etc) (If the operation is too complex skip to Integration test)
- Exceptions

**What Not to Unit Test?**

- Complex DB queries
- Constructors or properties (if they just return variables). Test them only if they contain validations.
- Configurations like constants, readonly fields, configs, enumerations, etc.
- Facades of just wrapping other frameworks or libraries
- Complex multi-threading code (it is better to be tested with integration tests)
- Methods that call another public method
- Exception messages
- POCO classes ‚Äî models, etc.

Ref: https://dzone.com/articles/unit-testing-guidelines-what-to-test-and-what-not

**For Flutter:**

- A unit test tests a single function, method, or class.
- A widget test (in other UI frameworks referred to as component test) tests a single widget.
- An integration test tests a complete app or a large part of an app.

**Mock dependencies using Mockito**

Mock: A mock is a substitute for a real object. Help to test an expected behavior of a real object.

- A passing test might start failing if a web service or database returns unexpected results. This is known as a ‚Äúflaky test.‚Äù

# Research

Maskable is for Android Icons.

Verify if should be used...

```json
    {
      "src": "icons/Icon-maskable-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable"
    },
    {
      "src": "icons/Icon-maskable-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "maskable"
    }
```
